# Explanation:

---
Marks the start of a YAML document.

- hosts: all
This play applies to all hosts defined in your inventory file.

tasks:
Defines the list of actions (tasks) to perform on the hosts.

Task: "Ping All Host Nodes"

ping is a built-in Ansible module (not ICMP ping, but Ansible’s connection test).

It checks whether Ansible can connect to the host, authenticate, and run Python.

ping: null is equivalent to just ping: (since it doesn’t require any arguments).

remote_user: ansible
Runs the task as the Linux user ansible on the remote hosts.

This means your inventory hosts should allow SSH login as ansible (via password or key).

✅ Purpose:

This playbook is used just to verify connectivity between the control node and all managed nodes using the ansible user.
